# E31 — Real-image editing via FlowEdit + frequency-surgery conditioning

**Follow-up to E24/E30** (numbered E31). FlowEdit (Kulikov et al. 2024) edits a flow
model's output **without inversion** by integrating the difference between target- and
source-conditioned velocity fields and adding the resulting delta to the source latent.
E31's twist: the **target conditioning is a token-frequency surgery** of the source
conditioning (E24/E30 ops) — e.g. low band from the source prompt + high band from the edit
prompt — instead of a plain different prompt.

## Background (plain language)
*The HTML report (`results/e31/index.html`) carries the same glossary inline and leads each
scene with its before/after strip.*

- **Flow model & velocity** — Flux generates by following a learned **velocity field**
  `v(x, σ, C)` from noise (σ=1) to a clean latent (σ=0), conditioned on the text embedding `C`.
  `x0` is the clean source latent (from the source prompt, or VAE-encoded from a real image).
- **FlowEdit (inversion-free)** — no inversion back to noise; set `δ=0` and, stepping σ high→low,
  accumulate `δ += (σ_next−σ)·[v(x_tar, C_tar) − v(x_src, C_src)]`; the edit is `x0 + δ`. Only the
  **difference** between the two conditionings drives the change.
- **C_src vs C_tar** — `C_src` = source-prompt embedding; `C_tar` = target. If `C_tar = C_src` the
  difference is exactly zero → output is the source unchanged (the safety gate).
- **`--skip`** — fraction of the top (noisiest) steps to skip; higher = weaker edit / more source
  preserved (here 0.33).
- **Conditions** — `recon` = `C_tar=C_src` (the identity gate, must reproduce the source);
  `full` = `C_tar` is the **whole style prompt** (ordinary prompt-swap FlowEdit, the edit
  baseline); `swap_c0.25` / `swap_c0.4` = **frequency surgery** — token-axis spectrum with the
  **low band (0–0.25 / 0–0.4) from the source** and the **high band from the style**.
- **Metrics** — **CLIP→style** (↑ stronger edit), **CLIP→source** (↑ content kept),
  **px-dist→source** (↓ content kept; ≈0 for `recon`), **aesthetic** (↑ sanity). A good edit
  *raises* CLIP→style while *keeping* CLIP→source.

## Method (`experiments/e31_flowedit_freq.py`, Flux)

- **Flux velocity accessor** `flux_velocity(pipe, packed_x, sigma, pe, ppe, gids)` — a
  manual Flux transformer forward (packed latents + `img_ids`/`txt_ids` + guidance embed),
  mirroring `FluxPipeline`'s denoising call and the SD3.5 `velocity()` in
  `e21_spectral_edit.py`. `flux_sigmas` reproduces Flux's resolution-shifted σ grid.
- **FlowEdit (inversion-free):** `δ=0; for σ high→low: x_src=(1-σ)x0+σε; x_tar=x_src+δ;
  δ += (σ_next−σ)·(v(x_tar,C_tar) − v(x_src,C_src))`; edited `= x0 + δ`. `--skip` controls
  how many top (noisy) steps are skipped = edit strength.
- **Target conditioning** `C_tar = freq_surgery(C_src, C_style)` via `band_swap_1d` (low
  from source, high from style) at a couple of cuts; plus `full` (C_tar = style, plain
  prompt-swap FlowEdit) for comparison.
- **Source latent** `x0`: generated from the source prompt (exact caption — clean
  evaluation) by default, or VAE-encoded from a real image via `--real_dir <dir>/<key>.png`.
- **Reuse:** `load_flux_preencoded_lens` (E24), `flux_vae_decode` (E7), `gen_emb` (E10),
  `text_spectral_ops` band ops, `e9_clipt`/`fidelity_metrics` metrics, `e27_site` HTML.

## The identity property (and the gate)
If `C_tar == C_src` the velocity difference is **exactly zero**, so `δ=0` and the `recon`
condition reproduces the source **exactly by construction** — independent of the σ schedule.
The reconstruction gate (recon pixel-distance to source < 0.05) therefore validates the
VAE/packing path before any GPU is spent on the full run. A model-free `--part preflight`
checks the FlowEdit accumulation math on a synthetic linear field.

## Results (runai `e31-flowedit`, Flux, 3 scenes, 28 steps, skip=0.33, guidance 3.5)
Preflight (model-free) and the reconstruction gate both passed, then the full run completed.
Per-scene CLIP-to-style / CLIP-to-source / pixel-distance below; n=1 per cell.

**Reconstruction identity holds** (the gate). `recon` (C_tar=C_src) reproduces the source by
construction: px-dist **0.0031 / 0.0022 / 0.0029** (house_storm / cat_paint / street_snow).
The Flux velocity accessor, σ schedule, packing, and VAE path are all validated.

**Plain prompt-swap FlowEdit (`full`) edits — unevenly.** Strong on street_snow
(CLIP-style 0.093→**0.208**, px-dist 0.121), modest on house_storm (px-dist 0.063 but
CLIP-style barely moves, .094→.099), near-recon on cat_paint. So inversion-free FlowEdit
works on Flux, scene-dependent.

**Frequency-surgery target conditioning barely edits — the negative result.**
`swap_c0.25` / `swap_c0.4` (`band_swap`: low band from source, high band from style) leave
CLIP-style at **recon level** (street_snow 0.086 — *below* recon's 0.093; cat_paint 0.169 ≈
recon 0.168; house_storm 0.088–0.096) with small px-dist. Mechanism: the kept low band
anchors the conditioning to the source (E24/E30's "low band = owner"), so the velocity
difference `v(x,C_tar) − v(x,C_src)` stays ≈0 ⇒ δ≈0 ⇒ no edit; the style's high band is too
weak to redirect the flow (E24's "high band = weak style-strength knob"). Caveat: short
prompts collapse the two cuts onto the same integer frequency index (`swap_c0.25` ==
`swap_c0.4` exactly for street_snow).

**Bottom line.** Token-frequency surgery is **not** a usable handle for inversion-free
editing — it can't out-edit a plain prompt swap, and usually does nothing. This unifies the
text-freq thread (E24→E30→E31): the low band owns the result, and high-band injection is a
weak style knob, never a compositional or editing lever.

## Status
Complete. Preflight + recon gate + full run all passed on runai (`e31-flowedit`, Succeeded).
Results above; artifacts in `experiments/results/e31/` (`report.json` + per-scene
`<key>/strip.png` + self-contained `index.html`). Real-image editing (`--real_dir`) untested.
